## Overview

Seam Carving GUI is a user-friendly application built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to resize images while preserving important content. This technique is known as seam carving, which intelligently removes or adds pixels based on the significance of the content in the image.

The tool is designed for both beginners and advanced users, providing a simple interface to manipulate images efficiently. Whether you want to make an image fit a specific size or enhance its composition, this application is here to help.

## Features

- **Content-Aware Resizing**: Automatically detects and removes less important parts of an image.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Utilizes efficient algorithms to ensure quick processing times.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive interface built with Tkinter for easy navigation.
- **Image Manipulation**: Basic editing features like zooming and cropping.
- **Supports Various Formats**: Works with popular image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
- **Saliency Detection**: Identifies important areas in images to maintain focus.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Leverages OpenCV for advanced image processing capabilities.

## Installation

To set up the Seam Carving GUI on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Andre511-perez/SeamCarving-GUI.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SeamCarving-GUI
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Launch the GUI by executing:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Using the Seam Carving GUI is straightforward. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

1. **Open an Image**:
   Click on the "Open" button to select an image from your device.

2. **Adjust Settings**:
   Use the sliders to adjust the desired width and height. The application will display a preview of the resized image.

3. **Apply Seam Carving**:
   Click the "Resize" button to apply seam carving. The tool will process the image and show the result.

4. **Save the Image**:
   After resizing, you can save the new image by clicking the "Save" button.

5. **Explore Additional Features**:
   Experiment with cropping and zooming features to enhance your image further.
